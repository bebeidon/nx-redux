// Per-game "all badges cached" markers.

// The badge cache (<ra_dir>/badges) is one flat directory that grows to tens
// of thousands of files once every game's badges are downloaded. On exFAT a
// lookup in it scans the directory, so checking a large set file by file costs
// seconds on a cold boot. A marker records the badge names already known to be
// on disk for one game, so later launches can skip the per-file checks.
//
// Markers live in <ra_dir>/badge_sets/<game_id>.txt, one badge name per line.
// <ra_dir> is the ".ra" directory (SHARED_USERDATA_PATH "/.ra" on device).

// True when the game's marker lists every non-empty name in names.
